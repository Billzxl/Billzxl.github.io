I am a Ph.D. student at [Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://ai.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research interests include Large Language Model (LLM) related Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) research and Agent research. I also have some research on Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Gaussian Process (GP). Download[my CV (Chinese version)](../files/2023_1226_CV.pdf)
